Introduction
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pokemon Showdown is an online simulator focused solely on Pokemon battles. In these battles, each player can have up to six Pokemon, each with up to four possible moves, and the ultimate objective is to reduce all opposing Pokemon to zero health points. In this paper, we develop a self-play, proximal policy optimization based reinforcement learning model to teach an AI to play effectively.
